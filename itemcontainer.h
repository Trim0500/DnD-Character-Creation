* \brief Header file for the ItemContainer class
* 
* @author Tristan Lafleur (40245238)
*
* This file puts in the forwrad declarations for the ItemContainer class
* 
* The game rules involved in the design of this file follow the d20 5e DnD rules. Therefore, three container types exist for the
*     gameworld and character, Backpack, Worn Items and Treasure Chests. Chests need to be place on the gameworld map to supply
*     the character with loot to pick and choose from and into their backpack which can then have items be taken out and equipped.
* 
* The design of this file is to implement the generation for item containers by way of including a list of items, retreiving
*     the items by certain metrics and adding in new ones. While the specifications mention that a container can hold any number
*     of items, this does not hold true for every type such as the case of Worn Items whereby only 7 can be used. Therefore, 
*     a capacity parameter is put in place to limit a container. Since containers are set in stone, no randomness is found for
*     these objects unlike the actual items. The container is a subclass as it ends up having many similar properties to items
*     and so allows the containers to be easier to maintain and extend later on.
* 
* The libraries used in this file would be string, vector and algorithm. The reasoning for it is that there is a need to provide
*     and interface to have a data structure that allows for automatic resizing as containers can be dynamically sized throughout
*     runtime and the items in the structure need to be found and retreived.
