### Description

A program that simulates a DnD character campaign tool using the 5e ruleset submitted as an
assignment to Concorida University's COMP345 (Advanced Program Design with C++) course.

### Installation Instructions

This program was created using Visual Studio 2022 and uses the build tools for 2019.
In the zip file the solution is included along with the necessary source code to create a
build and run it. 

In order to make a successful build of the project, follow these steps

1. Create the following directory: "C:\dev\vcpkg"
2. Go to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild?pivots=shell-cmd
3. Follow the instructions to clone the vcpkg repository into the project
4. Open the solution in Visual Studio and wait for everything to load
5. Run the program
   -- NOTE: An initial build will take a long time to finish since vcpkg will need to download and configure
			the dependencies

Note: It may happen that 1 test may show as a failure, simply run the program again and it should
		resolve itself as this is part of the random tests.
