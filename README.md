### Description

A program that simulates a DnD character creation tool using the 5e ruleset submitted as an
assignment to Concorida University's COMP345 (Advanced Program Design with C++) course.

### Installation Instructions

This program was created using Visual Studio 2022 and uses the build tools for 2019.
In the zip file the solution is included along with the necessary source code to create a
build and run it. 

In order to make a successful build of the project, follow these steps

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio and wait for everything to load
2. Run the program

Note: It may happen that 1 test may show as a failure, simply run the program again and it should
		resolve itself as this is part of the random tests.
